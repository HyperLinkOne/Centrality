# tools
Here are some tools I use to speed up my development. Some are only mentioned, others  are ready to run scripts.

Explore! have fun.

## scripts
* grant_access_to_docker_facl.sh - used to set more advanced user rights. Is needed to  circumvent the struggles 
of permissions when commands are executed in the container. By default login into the container means you are root.
Since facl-rights are handed down to new files/dirs the struggle is over.


## standard software I use
* zsh
* meld - Desktop tool to compare files / directories, very help full
* IDE - phpstorm
